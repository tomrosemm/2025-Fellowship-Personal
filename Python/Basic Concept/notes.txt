Breakdown of the workflow, based on the original paper's description:

Part One
1. Vehicle generates an OTP using unique secret and timestamp
2. OTP is embedded into a ZKP, proving the OTP valid without revealing the secret
3. ZKP is sent to the RSU, where it is verified
4. Upon successful verification, the RSU sends a signal to the vehicle authenticating it and proceeding with session

Part Two
1. ZKP-OTP proof is submitted to RSU
2. RSU invokes a smart contract on the blockchain, verifying the ZKP-OTP proof
3. The blockchain logs the event, including anonymized record of the vehicleâ€™s identity and authentication status
4. The outcome is returned to the infrastructure, which grants or denies access.
