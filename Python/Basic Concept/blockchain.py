Purpose:
    Simulates the invocation of a blockchain smart contract for ZKP-OTP verification and logs authentication events.

Methodology:
    - Anonymizes vehicle IDs using hashing before logging.
    - Simulates a smart contract call and logs the event with vehicle hash, timestamp, and authentication status.
    - Returns the outcome to mimic infrastructure access control.

Function: simulate_blockchain_verification

Simulate invoking a smart contract for ZKP-OTP verification and logging the event.
Args:
    vehicle_id (str): The unique identifier for the vehicle.
    zkp_proof (str): The zero-knowledge proof generated by the vehicle.
    timestamp (int): The timestamp associated with the OTP.
    verification_result (bool): The result of RSU verification (True if authenticated).
Returns:
    bool: The outcome of the simulated blockchain verification (same as input verification_result).
